TESTING

To test this website and ensure it works across multiple platforms I completed testing. 
Using Google Chrome's devtools I tested the responsiveness of each webpage and have 
made sure that the website works in multiple devices. I used media queries, CSS grid layout, 
and flexbox. 

I will include some user personas that I created in order to build a website that is user friendly.

User persona #1

Name: John Johnny
Occupation: Aerospace Engineer, employed
Demographic: 30 years old, lives in Los Angeles. Single with no children, upper-middle income level 
Description: Has latest iPhone device, a 2 year old iPad, 3 year old Macbook, and a new custom built PC running 
latest version of Windows.
Web browser choice is Google Chrome across all devices.

User persona #2

User name: Molly Martin
Occupation: High School Teacher, employed
Demographic: 55 years old, lives in St. Louis. Married with 2 children (18 and 20 years old), 
lower-middle income level
Description: This user does not prioritize mobile phone usage and prefers using a desktop computer or
laptop to use the internet. This user does not have a newer computer; her desktop is 5 years old and runs
current Windows version. She does update her browser when prompted and is used to browsing the web on a 
desktop. This user has the settings in the browser for font size increased, so they require the websiteâ€™s 
font be accessible.
