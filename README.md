# [Adopt a Dog]
https://bfelt001.github.io/html200-adopt-a-dog/

*Project demonstrating a website to adopt dogs*

## Description

The Adopt A Dog website is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla and jQuery) and runs 
on all current browsers on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. There are four pages of this website:
1. The homepage: displays adoptable dogs and an aside with blog posts
2. The All Dogs page: displays all available adoptable dogs only
3. The Blog page: displays 3 blog posts
4. Checkout page: displays a submittable form with an example of 2 dogs in the shopping cart

This website was a course project during the University of Washington Certificate for Front-end
Web Development. For this project, we were given a mock up for each webpage of a website to emmulate 
for a dog adoption agency. We were given the images and instructions on how the pages should function. 
The files we were given can be found in the html200-adopt-a-dog repository.

The website simulates adding a dog to adopt to a shopping cart, updating the price on the page, 
dynamically generating blog posts using Javascript, and checkout via a submittable form.
